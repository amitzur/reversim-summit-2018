Each company had its own unique culture, products and management style. 
Like many of you - several times ideas I really believed could make a difference, got dismissed by my managers. At first I got frustrated. Then, I told myself they were short-sighted. Then, I quit.

Luckily, I’ve learned that I’ve been pointing my finger in the wrong direction. It took me a few years to ask myself - what can I do differently to make my ideas succeed despite the initial and natural resistance to different ideas.

Determined to find a way to push my next ideas past the resistance - “Go Public” was born; A popular meetup that enables anyone to practice the communication skills required to push their ideas forward.</p></div></div><div class="_375unl-89ILg39QIuzGE1T p-3 line-height-12" data-reactid="398"><div class="font-weight-bold mb-1" data-reactid="399">Jenny Abramov</div><small class="" data-reactid="400">Software engineer by day, Choreographing ideas by night</small><div class="_2ws-nlJPxUrZbLtoP3pHy1 pt-3" data-reactid="401"><div class="d-flex align-items-center" data-reactid="402"><a target="_blank" class="flex-1 text-center" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyabramov/" data-reactid="403"><i class="fa fa-linkedin" data-reactid="404"></i></a></div></div></div></div></a></div><div class="mb-4 col-12 col-sm-6" data-reactid="405"><a class="_3YGzf9RWRAUIO1aU2RbROf" href="/speaker/59712109c6d3970017040957.html" data-reactid="406"><div class="IhePjM96IsBefXy5SpAJT ksrol-HJRfc9OdHdnPUis _2OEMGgOTMOOCUwz0k3t4-3" data-reactid="407"><div class="" data-reactid="408"><div style="background-image:url(&#x27;https://res.cloudinary.com/dtltonc5g/image/upload/w_300/v1500586941/bdvamlyjhfnv9ej5mlzg.jpg&#x27;);" class="_33VhgLTqr0aY0eTa-IDF4k" data-reactid="409"></div><div class="XPlty38dhICWKbsH2xQy1 flex-1" data-reactid="410"><p class="p-3 mb-0" data-reactid="411">Developer (NICE, SAP) -&gt; Architect (SAP, Imperva) -&gt; Chief Architect (Gett) -&gt; ?

Technion.
I was a developer for ~2.5 years but realized that I like more System/Operation/Devops (Whatever you call it these days :-) )
I am 42 years old and have ~20 years of experience. I worked at companies at all sizes, from startups to Enterprises.
I am married with 3 lovely kids.
I like to travel. I manage &quot;TIULUN&quot; which is a family traveling Facebook group with over 60K people.
I volunteer with NO-AR BESIKUN for ~12 years.
I am chasing floods at the desert.</p></div></div><div class="_375unl-89ILg39QIuzGE1T p-3 line-height-12" data-reactid="544"><div class="font-weight-bold mb-1" data-reactid="545">Nir Kriss</div><small class="" data-reactid="546">Head of Production Engineering at Outbrain</small><div class="_2ws-nlJPxUrZbLtoP3pHy1 pt-3" data-reactid="547"><div class="d-flex align-items-center" data-reactid="548"><a target="_blank" class="flex-1 text-center" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nir-kriss-72483b1/" data-reactid="549"><i class="fa fa-linkedin" data-reactid="550"></i></a></div></div></div></div></a></div><div class="mb-4 col-12 col-sm-6" data-reactid="551"><a class="_3YGzf9RWRAUIO1aU2RbROf" href="/speaker/594a59c6b4d48e0017aee890.html" data-reactid="552"><div class="IhePjM96IsBefXy5SpAJT _10739GLhvMRKljG1oTlam_ _2OEMGgOTMOOCUwz0k3t4-3" data-reactid="553"><div class="" data-reactid="554"><div style="background-image:url(&#x27;https://res.cloudinary.com/dtltonc5g/image/upload/w_300/v1500644828/rlfiyddkpqw7zqlbsi3f.png&#x27;);" class="_33VhgLTqr0aY0eTa-IDF4k" data-reactid="555"></div><div class="XPlty38dhICWKbsH2xQy1 flex-1" data-reactid="556"><p class="p-3 mb-0" data-reactid="557">I am a multidisciplinary developer who utilizes various programming languages and technology stacks.

In the last 3+ years I&#x27;ve worked a lot with react and angular and developed wix&#x27;s dashboard from scratch. In the last year I’ve been leading the Wix CRM Mobile team, writing Wix’s mobile app in react native. I&#x27;m also a mentor at WIX academy (WIX&#x27;s training program) and I like speaking about software in all of its forms.
Besides programming, I&#x27;m an adrenaline enthusiastic. From my latest hobby sailing to climbing, bungee through surfing, diving skiing and snowboarding. If it has adrenaline I&#x27;ve done it.

This talk will discuss the speaker's experiences leading high-performing engineering teams at Google, eBay, and Stitch Fix, and will discuss the organization, the processes, and the culture that can help a company move fast -- and even accelerate -- as it grows.\n\nModern software-service models take advantage of the great benefits in having the same team both build the software as well as operate it in production -- we call this DevOps, or simply \"You Build It; You Run It\". What does this mean in practice?\n\nOrganizationally, it means small teams with well-defined areas of responsibility, directly aligned with the business. The teams are cross-functional, meaning that each team has all the skill sets it requires to do its job, while at the same time relying on other teams for supporting services, tools, and libraries.\n\nProcess-wise, it means doubling down on practices like test-driven development and continuous delivery. Using continuous delivery practices, high-performing teams can and do release their applications and services multiple times a day. This enables them to iterate rapidly, experiment courageously, and fail more quickly.\n\nCulturally, it means end-to-end ownership. Each team owns its software end-to-end, from design to development to deployment to retirement. The same engineers who are responsible for the features are responsible for quality, performance, operations, and maintenance. This ownership puts incentives in the right place to encourage building maintainable, observable, and operable systems from the start.\n\nAll these techniques and approaches are available to everyone, and practical examples in this talk will help other organizations on their journey.","type":"full","tags":[],"speaker_ids":[{"_id":"59b40902de4db6712dd5d86c","proposals":["59b40a87de4db6712dd5d86d"],"name":"Randy Shoup","oneLiner":"VP Engineering at StitchFix, Previously @Google & @Ebay","isReversimTeamMember":false,"bio":"Randy is a 25-year veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to eBay and Google.

This talk will discuss the speaker's experiences leading high-performing engineering teams at Google, eBay, and Stitch Fix, and will discuss the organization, the processes, and the culture that can help a company move fast -- and even accelerate -- as it grows.\n\nModern software-service models take advantage of the great benefits in having the same team both build the software as well as operate it in production -- we call this DevOps, or simply \"You Build It; You Run It\". What does this mean in practice?\n\nOrganizationally, it means small teams with well-defined areas of responsibility, directly aligned with the business. The teams are cross-functional, meaning that each team has all the skill sets it requires to do its job, while at the same time relying on other teams for supporting services, tools, and libraries.\n\nProcess-wise, it means doubling down on practices like test-driven development and continuous delivery. Using continuous delivery practices, high-performing teams can and do release their applications and services multiple times a day. This enables them to iterate rapidly, experiment courageously, and fail more quickly.\n\nCulturally, it means end-to-end ownership. Each team owns its software end-to-end, from design to development to deployment to retirement. The same engineers who are responsible for the features are responsible for quality, performance, operations, and maintenance. This ownership puts incentives in the right place to encourage building maintainable, observable, and operable systems from the start.\n\nAll these techniques and approaches are available to everyone, and practical examples in this talk will help other organizations on their journey.","type":"full","tags":[],"speaker_ids":[{"_id":"59b40902de4db6712dd5d86c","proposals":["59b40a87de4db6712dd5d86d"],"name":"Randy Shoup","oneLiner":"VP Engineering at StitchFix, Previously @Google & @Ebay","isReversimTeamMember":false,"bio":"Randy is a 25-year veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to eBay and Google.
