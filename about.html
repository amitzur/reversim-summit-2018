Rather than falling into either utopian or dystopian traps, we will attempt a dispassionate  analysis of what is happening. What gets lost in the exchange for the gains of the digital? What do we gain in return?\n\nWe will ask the questions surrounding the Death(?) of Privacy, Distance, Center, Time, Tangibility, Books, Classroom, Truth, Conversation, Promise, Choice, Memory and perhaps even the Death of Death itself.\n\nScience Fiction, Film, Art, Engineering and the Halls of Science are engaging with these questions.

This talk will discuss the speaker's experiences leading high-performing engineering teams at Google, eBay, and Stitch Fix, and will discuss the organization, the processes, and the culture that can help a company move fast -- and even accelerate -- as it grows.\n\nModern software-service models take advantage of the great benefits in having the same team both build the software as well as operate it in production -- we call this DevOps, or simply \"You Build It; You Run It\". What does this mean in practice?\n\nOrganizationally, it means small teams with well-defined areas of responsibility, directly aligned with the business. The teams are cross-functional, meaning that each team has all the skill sets it requires to do its job, while at the same time relying on other teams for supporting services, tools, and libraries.\n\nProcess-wise, it means doubling down on practices like test-driven development and continuous delivery. Using continuous delivery practices, high-performing teams can and do release their applications and services multiple times a day. This enables them to iterate rapidly, experiment courageously, and fail more quickly.\n\nCulturally, it means end-to-end ownership. Each team owns its software end-to-end, from design to development to deployment to retirement. The same engineers who are responsible for the features are responsible for quality, performance, operations, and maintenance. This ownership puts incentives in the right place to encourage building maintainable, observable, and operable systems from the start.\n\nAll these techniques and approaches are available to everyone, and practical examples in this talk will help other organizations on their journey.","type":"full","tags":[],"speaker_ids":[{"_id":"59b40902de4db6712dd5d86c","proposals":["59b40a87de4db6712dd5d86d"],"name":"Randy Shoup","oneLiner":"VP Engineering at StitchFix, Previously @Google & @Ebay","isReversimTeamMember":false,"bio":"Randy is a 25-year veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to eBay and Google.

Each company had its own unique culture, products and management style. \nLike many of you - several times ideas I really believed could make a difference, got dismissed by my managers. At first I got frustrated. Then, I told myself they were short-sighted. Then, I quit.\n\nLuckily, I’ve learned that I’ve been pointing my finger in the wrong direction. It took me a few years to ask myself - what can I do differently to make my ideas succeed despite the initial and natural resistance to different ideas.\n\nDetermined to find a way to push my next ideas past the resistance - “Go Public” was born; A popular meetup that enables anyone to practice the communication skills required to push their ideas forward.","gender":"other","picture":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PKiMhRcugIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAjjs/EKs0AZy219c/photo.jpg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyabramov/","twitter":"","stackOverflow":"","github":"","href":"595c821939ff930017c5283a.html"}],"attended":false,"href":"70c5d0d3-e3e1-710d-bc8a-09d5a6eabf69.html"}]},{"_id":"59712109c6d3970017040957","proposals":["59712387c6d3970017040958"],"name":"Lior Bar-On","oneLiner":"An Architect and a Blogger.","isReversimTeamMember":false,"bio":"Developer (NICE, SAP) -> Architect (SAP, Imperva) -> Chief Architect (Gett) -> ?\nBlogging @http://www.softwarearchiblog.com","gender":"male","picture":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtltonc5g/image/upload/w_300/v1500586941/bdvamlyjhfnv9ej5mlzg.jpg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/liorbo/","twitter":"@baronlior","stackOverflow":"","github":"https://github.com/baronlior","href":"59712109c6d3970017040957.html","sessions":[{"_id":"59712387c6d3970017040958","id":"cbcc3966-0df2-f37a-0590-857f5401791a","title":"Effective Software Design (ESD)","abstract":"All developers (but the \"Bravest\", \"Stupidest\", or \"Busiest\") spend time on Software Design.\nWhere and how did we learn how to do it?\nWhat method do you follow?

The teams are cross-functional, meaning that each team has all the skill sets it requires to do its job, while at the same time relying on other teams for supporting services, tools, and libraries.\n\nProcess-wise, it means doubling down on practices like test-driven development and continuous delivery. Using continuous delivery practices, high-performing teams can and do release their applications and services multiple times a day. This enables them to iterate rapidly, experiment courageously, and fail more quickly.\n\nCulturally, it means end-to-end ownership. Each team owns its software end-to-end, from design to development to deployment to retirement. The same engineers who are responsible for the features are responsible for quality, performance, operations, and maintenance. This ownership puts incentives in the right place to encourage building maintainable, observable, and operable systems from the start.\n\nAll these techniques and approaches are available to everyone, and practical examples in this talk will help other organizations on their journey.","type":"full","tags":[],"speaker_ids":[{"_id":"59b40902de4db6712dd5d86c","proposals":["59b40a87de4db6712dd5d86d"],"name":"Randy Shoup","oneLiner":"VP Engineering at StitchFix, Previously @Google & @Ebay","isReversimTeamMember":false,"bio":"Randy is a 25-year veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to eBay and Google.
